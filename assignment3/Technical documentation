6. com.cafeteria.ordering.Customer Delivery / Canteen Ordering System
Description: Ordering system for a canteen or delivery service with menu management and order tracking.
Milestone 1 (Assignment 3 – Exceptions, JDBC, SOLID):
• • Entities: com.cafeteria.ordering.Customer, com.cafeteria.menumanagement.MenuItem, com.cafeteria.ordering.Order(userId,itemsId(array),boolean completed,), com.cafeteria.ordering.OrderItem.
• • Tables: customers, menu_items, orders, order_items.
• • User stories: place an order, view active orders, mark order as completed.
• • Exceptions: menu item not available; order not found; invalid quantity.
• • SOLID: com.cafeteria.ordering.OrderService, com.cafeteria.menumanagement.MenuService, PaymentService; repositories separate from business logic.
Milestone 2 (Assignment 4 – Language Features & Design Patterns):
• • Use generics for collections and responses (List<com.cafeteria.ordering.Order>, Result<T>).
• • Singleton for PricingRules or TaxConfig.
• • Builder for com.cafeteria.ordering.Order (gradually adding items, customer, delivery details).
• • Factory for delivery options (PickupOrder, DeliveryOrder, DineInOrder).
Endterm (Final project defense & Component Principles):
• • Components: OrderingComponent, MenuManagementComponent, DeliveryComponent, BillingComponent.
• • Analyze how the components can be reused in another context (e.g., cafeteria vs. external delivery).
• • During defense, show the complete order lifecycle and discuss component dependencies.
